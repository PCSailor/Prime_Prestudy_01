    <h1>Phil Curtis' Prework Assignment_Week 3</h1>
    <h2>THE FUNCTION CHALLENGE + GIT</h2>
    <p>
For this assignment, you will need to create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.  <br>
The HTML only need to have a header that reads "Function Challenge" with just a little styling in the CSS. <br>
Then, create a function in the Javascript that console logs out "Hey this works!". <br>
Then you will need to check in the project into a personal GitHub repo (Note: NOT GitHub pages).
  </p>
  <p>
Use the following naming conventions for your files and repository:<br>
HTML file - "index.html"<br>
CSS file - "styles.css"<br>
JavaScript file - "script.js"<br>
GitHub repo - "prime_prestudy_01".<br>
The goal of this assignment is to prove that you have a handle on how all of the pages 'link' together and that you can get a project posted to GitHub.

Bonus Challenge:<br>
TO-DOMore functions!
    </p>
    <p>
Ok, console logs are great, but lets actually make functions that do things.
Create three functions, each taking in a single number. Then do something to that number and return a new number. Then call each of those functions in one giant chain.
Assuming that you set this up correctly, you should get a numerical return that is a combination of all the functions running, taking in a function in the place of a number. EVEN IF YOU GET THIS WORKING AND ARE UNSURE OF 'WHY' IT WORKS, thats OK. This is just showing you that you can use functions in place of many things. We will dive deep into these concepts in class!
    </p>
    <p>
Example:<br>
      add(multiply(subtract(2)));<br>
      Function Name	What It Does<br>
      add	Add 2 to the number<br>
      multiply	Multiply the number by 3<br>
      subtract	Subtract 4 from the number
    </p>
    <p>
Once you are complete, save it to a file named "scripts.js" and check it into a repo titled "prime_prestudy_bonus_week_03"
